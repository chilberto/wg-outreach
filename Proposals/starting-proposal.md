## Title: 

Request for Financial Support for the https://start.ng/ remote internship programme

## Description:

The Start.ng remote internship programme is a yearly programme in Nigeria that introduces beginners to software developers. It typically has about 5000 - 10000 participants and about 60% of the number continue to pursue a career in tech with the top 20% getting hired immediately after the programme.

The programme has never had a dotnet track as organizers are majorly Javascript and Php focused, this year I was able to convince them to let me facilitate a C# track. We currently have over 500 learners learning C# with options including go, js, php, kotlin and java to pick from.

The mode of delivery is that an instructor makes tutorial videos, see a developing playlist here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT67VI0QhgU&list=PLL0ge2KQPI3UggX17Nkfl3l6XN7aIK6Lm.>
We currently have almost 3000 views on just 3 videos and lots of testimonials (please read video comments). Tasks are delivered on an Internal board and communication is on slack. (We could use teams given a license. :)).

## Measure of impact:

Immediate 500 students, potential - 5000. 

Most of these beginners are looking for "cool languages" and I want to pose dotnet as that. We already have students switching from othert languages to C# because of testimonials from other learners. If we start to change the mindset of the younger population that dotnet is cool the impact is that companies have more dotnet talent to hire, and we have more people spreading the awesomeness of dotnet.

## Requested Budget:

$5000

This amount is used to pay interns for projects (yes stipends are paid out to keep them motivated), we also provide them stipends to fund internet needs as that can be a real challenge in Nigeria.

## Size of Committee Requested:

3 volunteers.

I am currently handling all the tutoring myself and could use a volunteer from the foundation to make ocassional short talk videos.

## Which Goal and Priority is this project aligned with:

- Encourage new developers to build with .NET
- Affinity group outreach and sponsorship

## How will we know this outreach is successful?

From the number of students that complete the C# track on this programme, and the number of C# signups the next version has.

I will close by saying myself and thousands of Nigerian developers today went through either this programme, or others like it. It is a real oppurtunity for the foundation to key into a place that is non-typical for it.
