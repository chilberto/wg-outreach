# Outreach Proposals - WiP

Members can secure resources from the .NET Foundation to lead and implement outreach initiatives. Initiatives will be determined via the proposal process. They will be prioritized and voted on based on the size of impact and interest. Committees will be formed around initiatives and will check in with the Outreach group in monthly meetings. 
Proposals are reviewed on a first-come-first-served basis. 

## Proposal Alignment and Submission

Proposals for Outreach should align with our goals and priorities. They should be added with a pull request to the [Proposals](./Proposals) folder. They should include the following information:

- Title
- Description
- Measure of impact (this can be number of people reached, potential size of group, current number of meetup members...etc)
- Requested Budget
- Size of Comittee Requested (how many people do you need to get this off the ground)
- Which Goal and Priority is this project aligned with
- How will we know this project has been successful?
